        PRAY ONCE: Queen of Martyrs, your heart suffered so much. I beg you, by
        the merits of the tears you shed in these terrible and sorrowful times,
        to obtain for me and all the sinners of the world the grace of complete
        sincerity and repentance. Amen.

        PRAY THRICE: Mary, who was conceived without sin and who suffered for
        us, pray for us.
